\documentclass[11pt, twoside, openany]{book} 
% 'book' provides chapters, front matter, and appendices.
% '11pt' sets the base font size, improves readability for long texts. By modifying 11pt, we can select a new letter size for the full document.
% 'twoside' enables double-sided layout (left/right pages), used for printed theses.
% 'openany' starts chapters on either page (no forced blanks). Use openright for traditional print (chapters on right-hand/odd pages).
% More details about how margins are managed in the document will be explained in the Preamble

% Dedication / Epigraph

\thispagestyle{plain} %Page number centered at the bottom; no header
\vspace*{5cm} 
% Adds vertical space to position the dedication text. Regular \vspace{5cm} might not work at the top of a page, because LaTeX can ignore vertical space there. \vspace*{5cm} forces LaTeX to apply the space even at the top of a page, which is exactly what you want for a dedication page. Adjustable: You can change 5cm to any value (e.g., 3cm, 7cm) depending on how far down you want the dedication text to appear.
\begin{center}
    \emph{To my family,\\  
    and friends.}
    % \emph{...} = emphasized text (typically italics)

Ensuring the reproducibility of your results is a cornerstone of good scientific practice. There are many ways to present experimental details and computational settings; here, we focus on demonstrating how to include code within your thesis. 

In LaTeX, we can include Python code using the \texttt{minted} package,
which provides nice syntax highlighting. Below is a simple example 
to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle using Pythagoras' theorem.

%%%In the following code \begin{minted}   Wraps the  code you want to display. {python} tells minted which language to highlight. Everything inside is shown in the PDF with proper colours and formatting, but it is not executed.
% Code formatting in the PDF Indentation, keywords, comments, and strings are automatically highlighted by minted. This makes the code readable and professional-looking, ideal for tutorials, homework, or papers.

\begin{minted}{python}   

import math

def pythagoras(a, b):
    return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)

# Example usage
side1 = 3
side2 = 4
hypotenuse = pythagoras(side1, side2)
print("Hypotenuse:", hypotenuse)
\end{minted}
