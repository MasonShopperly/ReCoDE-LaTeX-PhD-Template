\section*{Executive Summary}

\noindent\textbf{Context.}
Adaptive spectral/\(hp\) CFD delivers accuracy efficiently by concentrating resolution where physics demands it (e.g., near-wall layers, wakes, shear regions).
But adaptivity changes the workload shape: localized high-\(P\) regions can dominate cost, and parallel throughput becomes sensitive to how those regions are distributed across ranks/devices.

\vspace{0.35em}
\noindent\textbf{Problem.}
On heterogeneous CPU/GPU clusters, timestep time is throttled by the slowest partition during synchronized phases (especially global solves).
Naive partitioning (e.g., equal element counts) can waste throughput when per-element cost varies strongly with \(P\), and periodic “rebalance every \(k\)” policies can incur overhead even when the mapping barely changes.

\vspace{0.35em}
\noindent\textbf{Preliminary measurements (what we already know).}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Superlinear cost with \(P\):} measured runtime scales approximately as \(P^{2.68}\) in a representative sweep (\(r^2 \approx 0.9985\)). \textbf{Implication:} balance must be cost-weighted, not count-based.
  \item \emph{Hotspot-driven imbalance:} clustered refinement can yield max/mean load ratios \(\approx 2.7\text{--}4.0\). \textbf{Implication:} adaptive meshes create localized “time hotspots” that dominate wall time if co-located on the same rank/device.
  \item \emph{Solve dominance:} pressure+viscous phases can consume \(\sim 0.8\text{--}0.85\) of the timestep at higher core counts. \textbf{Implication:} rebalancing benefit must be evaluated at the phase level; some time is intrinsically global-coupled.
  \item \emph{Policy signal:} a triggered policy can match periodic performance while reducing rebalance events. \textbf{Implication:} the core lever is deciding \emph{when} to rebalance based on predicted net gain.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Thesis.}
Achieve predictable throughput for adaptive spectral/\(hp\) CFD on heterogeneous systems by making load (and rebalancing) measurable and controllable:
(i) calibrate cost and overhead models, (ii) compute heterogeneity-aware weights/mappings, and (iii) rebalance only when predicted benefit exceeds repartition+migration+coordination cost under bounded movement.

\noindent\textbf{Contributions.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A Nektar++-anchored hook-point map for the adapt \(\leftrightarrow\) partition lifecycle.
  \item A calibrated cost model that supports heterogeneity-aware weighting/mapping.
  \item A triggered, bounded-migration rebalancing policy evaluated against periodic baselines with phase-aware metrics.
\end{itemize}
