\section*{Executive Summary}

High-fidelity CFD is increasingly limited not by whether a method is accurate, but by whether it runs \emph{predictably} and \emph{efficiently} at scale.
Adaptive high-order methods are attractive because they concentrate numerical effort where the physics demands it; however, that same adaptivity creates strongly uneven work distributions that can throttle parallel throughput.

On modern clusters, two effects collide.
First, the wall time of a timestep is often governed by the \emph{slowest} partition because synchronized phases and globally coupled solves force ranks/devices to wait for one another.
Second, heterogeneous hardware means that “equal work” depends on device throughput and on which phases dominate the timestep.
As a result, simple heuristics (e.g., equal element counts, or rebalancing periodically every \(k\) steps) can waste compute time: they can leave expensive regions co-located on the same partition, or trigger rebalances whose overhead exceeds their benefit.

\noindent\textbf{Thesis.}
Achieve predictable throughput for adaptive high-order CFD on heterogeneous systems by making rebalancing a measurable decision:
(i) calibrate models for \emph{benefit} (how much time is saved by improving the mapping) and \emph{cost} (repartition+migration+coordination overhead),
(ii) compute heterogeneity-aware weights/mappings, and
(iii) rebalance only when predicted net gain is positive, under bounded migration to prevent churn.

\noindent\textbf{Preliminary signals (measured, motivating the approach).}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Per-element cost rises sharply with local approximation order} (polynomial order \(P\)): measured timestep cost scales approximately as \(P^{2.68}\) in a representative sweep (\(r^2 \approx 0.9985\)). \textbf{So:} balance must be cost-weighted, not count-based.
  \item \emph{Localized refinement produces time hotspots:} clustered refinement yields max/mean load ratios \(\approx 2.7\text{--}4.0\). \textbf{So:} adaptive meshes can throttle wall time if hotspots co-locate on one rank/device.
  \item \emph{Not all timestep time is “balance-sensitive”:} pressure+viscous phases can consume \(\sim 0.8\text{--}0.85\) of the timestep at higher core counts. \textbf{So:} gains must be evaluated phase-by-phase; some time is intrinsically global-coupled.
  \item \emph{Decision policies matter:} triggered rebalancing can match periodic performance while reducing rebalance events. \textbf{So:} the primary lever is a reliable gate based on predicted net gain.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A Nektar++-anchored hook-point map for the adapt \(\leftrightarrow\) partition lifecycle.

  \item A triggered, bounded-migration rebalancing policy evaluated against periodic baselines with explicit overhead accounting.
