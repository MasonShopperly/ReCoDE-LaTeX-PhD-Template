## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

The main objective of this project is to develop a **standardised, user-friendly LaTeX template** that:

1. **Conforms strictly** to Imperial College London's thesis presentation regulations and formatting requirements.  
2. **Facilitates consistency** in typography, structure, and referencing across departments and research groups.  
3. **Simplifies the writing process** for postgraduate researchers by providing pre-defined environments for chapters, sections, figures, tables, and appendices.  
4. **Integrates best practices** in academic writing, including compatibility with BibLaTeX for references and packages for mathematical typesetting, graphics, and indexing.  
5. **Ensures long-term maintainability**, with modular configuration files (e.g., `preamble.tex`) for easy customisation.

## ✅ Prerequisites

### 📚 Academic
- Familiarity with **LaTeX** and basic document compilation workflows.  
- Understanding of **academic writing conventions** and thesis structure (chapters, abstracts, references, appendices).  
- Optional: Experience with **BibLaTeX**, **Biber**, and reference management tools (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley).  

### 💻 System 

You can work either locally or directly in Overleaf — choose the workflow that suits you best.

Option A — Overleaf (no local installation required):

  - Use **Overleaf** to compile and manage your thesis online.
  - Note: Overleaf project size and quota limits depend on your plan.

Option B — Local setup:

  - Install a **LaTeX distribution**: [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/), or [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/).
  - Recommended compiler: **XeLaTeX** or **LuaLaTeX** (for Unicode and modern font support).
  - Ensure **Biber** is installed if you use **BibLaTeX**.
  - Compatible with **TeXstudio**, **VS Code (LaTeX Workshop)**, or any LaTeX IDE.
  - Requirements: Minimum **5 GB free disk space** for LaTeX and auxiliary files.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to begin using the Imperial College London PhD Thesis Template:

Option A — Overleaf:

  - Import the project via "New Project → Import from GitHub" or "New Project → Upload Project" (ZIP).
  - In Project Settings, set **Compiler** to **XeLaTeX** or **LuaLaTeX**.
  - If using **BibLaTeX**, set **Bibliography tool** to **Biber**.
  - Click **Recompile** and start editing files (e.g., `preamble.tex`, `chapters/`).

Option B — Local setup (after installing a LaTeX distribution):

  - Clone the repository:
    
         ```bash
         git clone https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/ReCoDE-LaTeX-PhD-Template.
         ```
  - The LaTeX source files are found in the [phd-thesis](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/ReCoDE-LaTeX-PhD-Template/tree/main/phd-thesis) directory. Open the directory in your IDE and compile (example):
    
         ```bash
         latexmk -pdf -xelatex main.tex
         ```
    
      or
    
         ```bash
         latexmk -pdf -lualatex main.tex
         ```
  - Ensure **Biber** runs for references (BibLaTeX workflow).
         
  - Note: If you do not have access to the repository, contact the [Early Career Researcher Institute](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/early-career-researcher-institute/).
