## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

The main objective of this project is to develop a **standardized, user-friendly LaTeX template** that:

1. **Conforms strictly** to Imperial College London’s thesis presentation regulations and formatting requirements.  
2. **Facilitates consistency** in typography, structure, and referencing across departments and research groups.  
3. **Simplifies the writing process** for postgraduate researchers by providing pre-defined environments for chapters, sections, figures, tables, and appendices.  
4. **Integrates best practices** in academic writing, including compatibility with BibLaTeX for references and packages for mathematical typesetting, graphics, and indexing.  
5. **Ensures long-term maintainability**, with modular configuration files (e.g., `preamble.tex`, `settings.tex`) for easy customization.

## 🎯 Target Audience

This LaTeX template is designed primarily for **postgraduate researchers** preparing their **Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)** theses at **Imperial College London**, but it can also benefit a broader academic audience.

### The following groups will find this exemplar particularly useful:

#### 1. PhD Candidates at Imperial College London
- Students seeking a compliant, ready-to-use LaTeX framework that meets official thesis formatting regulations.  
- Researchers aiming to produce a professional and consistent document for both printed and electronic submission.  

#### 2. Supervisors and Research Advisors
- Academics who wish to provide their students with a standardised, institutionally aligned thesis format.  
- Supervisors reviewing draft theses who value a consistent structure for efficient feedback.  

#### 3. Departmental Administrators and Graduate Schools
- Departments interested in maintaining uniformity in the presentation of theses across research groups.  
- Administrative teams developing departmental LaTeX templates derived from this core structure.  

#### 4. Postgraduate Researchers from Other Institutions
- Scholars from other universities looking for a high-quality exemplar of a compliant UK-style PhD thesis format.  
- Researchers who wish to adapt Imperial’s clear, modular structure for their own institutional guidelines.

## Disciplinary Background 🔬
     
Briefly describe how this project fits in your discipline, why you chose
to work on it, and what other disciplines may find it useful.


<!-- Software. What languages, libraries, software you use. -->
## Software Tools 🛠️

Programming language(s), libraries, and scientific software used.


<!-- Repository structure. Explain how your code is structured. -->
## Project Structure 🗂️

Overview of code organisation and structure.

Code is organised into logical components:

- `notebooks` for tutorials and exercises
- `src` for core code, potentially divided into further modules
- `data` within `src` for datasets
- `docs` for documentation
- `test` for testing scripts


<!-- Roadmap.
Identify the project core (a minimal working example). This
is what you should develop first, ideally by week 6. Defining
a core helps ensure that, despite a tight timeline, we will end
up with a complete project.

Identify project extensions. These are additional features that
you will implement after the core of the project is finished; you
could also propose extensions as open-ended exercises for the ReCoDE
audience.

Outline the process of creating the exemplar as a project roadmap
with individual steps. This will help you with defining the scope of 
the project. When you think about this, imagine that you are explaining
it to a new PhD student. Assume that this student is from a related (but
not necessarily same) discipline. They can code but have never undertaken
a larger project. The steps should follow logical development of the
project and good practice. Each will be relatively independent and contain
its own learning annotation and links to other learning materials if
appropriate. The learning annotation is going to form a significant portion
of your efforts.

Learning annotations will evolve as we go along but planning now will be useful
in defining your exemplar steps. Remember that active learning is generally more
valuable than just reading information, so small exercises that build on previous
steps can really help your students to understand the software development process.
You can include videos, text, charts, images, flowcharts, storyboards, or anything
creative that you may think of.

Completed tasks are marked with an x between the square brackets.
