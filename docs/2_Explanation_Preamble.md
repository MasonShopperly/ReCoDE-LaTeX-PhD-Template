## Preamble Explanation

The **preamble** in a LaTeX document is a section defined *before* `\begin{document}`that controls the **formatting, structure, typography, citation style, margins, and overall layout** of the entire thesis.

In this template, the preamble is configured to ensure:

✅ Compliance with **Imperial College Thesis Requirements** (Sections 4.1–4.6)  
✅ Correct margins and page layout as required by **Regulation 4.3**  
✅ Continuous Arabic numbering from the title page as required by **Regulation 4.4**  
✅ Professional typesetting of text, figures, tables, and mathematics  
✅ Clear, accessible PDF structure for electronic submission  
✅ A clean and modern academic style appropriate for engineering and design research  

Students normally do not need to modify the preamble, but understanding it helps ensure your thesis remains compliant and professionally formatted.
