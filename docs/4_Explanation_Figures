## Figures Explanation 📊

This page explains how to structure and use **multi‑panel figures** in the results chapter of your thesis. The goal is not to dictate your scientific content, but to give you reusable patterns for presenting it clearly and consistently.
From an Imperial College compliance perspective, figures must be **clearly legible, consistently formatted, and properly referenced** in the text. The checklist also expects that all figures are numbered in a single logical sequence (Figure 1.1, 1.2, …) and that each one has a **descriptive caption** and is actually **discussed in the main text**, rather than left unexplained.
### Why multi‑panel figures?

A dedicated results chapter is standard in most thesis formats. In this chapter, figures often do the heavy lifting: they communicate **trends, comparisons, and patterns** more efficiently than paragraphs of text. Multi‑panel figures:

- Allow you to **compare multiple conditions** or time points in one place.
- Help the reader see **relationships and progressions** at a glance.
- Reduce the need for separate, repetitive single‑panel figures.

### 2×2 multi‑panel figure (four panels)

The first example (Figure `four_panels`) uses a $$2 \times 2$$ layout (panels a–d). This is a good pattern when:

- You have **four related scenarios** (e.g. different parameter settings, methods, or time points).
- You want a **single caption** that explains how the panels relate.
- You need a concise visual summary instead of four separate figures.

Key ideas illustrated by this template:

- Each subfigure has its own **caption** and **label**, so you can reference them individually (a, b, c, d).
- The overall **figure caption** explains what the four panels show collectively.
- You can cite the source of the data or images in the caption (e.g. `\cite{Gomes2022}`).
