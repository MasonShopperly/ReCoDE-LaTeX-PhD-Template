## Copyright, plagiarism, and permissions (Checklist §11)

Section 11 of the checklist is crucial for any material in your appendices (figures, tables, code, documents):

- Your thesis must **not contain plagiarism**, including copying code, text, or figures without proper attribution.
- You must have **permission** to reproduce any third‑party material (papers, images, figures, maps, code, etc.), including within the appendices.
- You must comply with any **sponsorship, confidentiality, or intellectual property** obligations (for example, if your work is industrially sponsored or contains sensitive data).

The checklist also specifies that you should include copies of **permission documents** in the appendices, so examiners can verify that you are allowed to reuse all third‑party material included in the thesis.
