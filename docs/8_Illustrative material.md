## Illustrative material and additional files (Checklist §10)

Sometimes, it will not practical to include relevant data in your thesis due to its size or format (e.g. videos, large datasets, software, or other digital artefacts). Section 10 of the checklist covers such **illustrative material** that you may want to provide alongside the thesis. Key points:

- Additional illustrative material may need to be submitted to the **Registry Assessment Records Team** via the channels specified (e.g. email or upload).
- Such material should be **clearly referenced** in your thesis, with a short description of what it is and how it relates to your work.
- Where possible, you should provide **stable access** (e.g. DOIs, repository links) and follow any departmental or funder data‑sharing policies.

In practice, your thesis might:

- Mention in a main chapter of your thesis that **source code, full datasets, or interactive notebooks** are available in a repository.
- Include a brief explanation in an appendix of what is in those external resources and how an examiner could use them.
