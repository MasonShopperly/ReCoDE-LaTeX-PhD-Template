```latex
\documentclass[11pt, twoside, openany]{book} 
% 'book' provides chapters, front matter, ccccccappendices and a well-structured layout suitable for theses.
% 
% '11pt' sets the base font size. You may select 10pt or 12pt if desired, but 11pt offers excellent readability.
%
% 'twoside' produces a double-sided layout (odd/even pages). 
% IMPORTANT: Imperial Thesis Regulation 4.3 requires *centred* text with symmetrical margins—handled in the preamble.
%
% 'openany' allows chapters to begin on either left or right pages.
% For a more traditional thesis layout, use 'openright' (chapters always begin on odd-numbered pages).
%
% Full details about margins, fonts, and styling are explained in the PREAMBLE.
